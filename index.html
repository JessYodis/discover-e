<div class="popup_author">Elly Griffiths</div>
<hr/>
<div class="popup_description">A captivating crime series by
  British mystery writer Elly Griffiths, featuring an irresistibly quirky
  heroine in Ruth Galloway. When she’s not digging up bones or other ancient
  objects, tart-tongued archaeologist Ruth Galloway lives happily alone in a
  remote area called Saltmarsh near Norfolk, land that was sacred to its Iron
  Age inhabitants&#8212;not quite earth, not quite sea. When a child’s bones
  are found on a desolate beach nearby, Detective Chief Inspector Harry Nelson
  calls Galloway for help. Nelson thinks he has found the remains of Lucy
  Downey, a little girl who went missing ten years ago. Since her disappearance
  he has been receiving bizarre letters about her, letters with references to
  ritual and sacrifice. The bones actually turn out to be two thousand years
  old, but Ruth is soon drawn into the Lucy Downey case and into the mind of
  the letter writer, who seems to have both archaeological knowledge and eerie
  psychic powers, luring Ruth into completely new territory&#8212;and serious
  danger.</div>

<div class="popup_author">Karin Fossum</div>
<hr/>
<div class="popup_description">Meet Inspector Sejer: smart and
  enigmatic, tough but fair. At the foot of the imposing Kollen Mountain lies a
  small, idyllic village, where neighbors know neighbors and children play
  happily in the streets. But when the body of a teenage girl is found by the
  lake at the mountaintop, the town's tranquility is shattered forever. Annie
  was strong, intelligent, and loved by everyone. What went so terribly wrong?
  Doggedly, yet subtly, Inspector Sejer uncovers layer upon layer of distrust
  and lies beneath the town's seemingly perfect façade. Critically acclaimed across Europe,
  Karin Fossum's Inspector Sejer novels are masterfully constructed,
  psychologically convincing, and compulsively readable. They evoke a world
  that is at once profoundly disturbing and terrifyingly familiar.</div>
